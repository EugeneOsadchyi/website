<h1>What are Microfrontends?</h1>

<p>Microfrontends are a way to build large web applications in a modular way. Each microfrontend is an independent solution for a “business concern”, meaning that it is a self-contained, small application which can be integrated into a web page.</p>

<p>This may not sound impressive, but it is a very powerful concept to build large-scale web applications in a “vertical” way where deliverable artefacts are aligned with business logic rather than technology. The opposite would be a “layered” architecture where artefacts are aligned with technical concerns such as frontend, backend, database.</p>
