<h2>History</h2>

<p>Several years ago, Alex was a Principal Architect at <a href="https://www.tui.com/">TUI</a>, the worlds largest tourism organisation, where he was leading the migration of several regional sales platforms into a global one. At the same time, he was writing his Masterâ€™s dissertation where he researched contract-, event-, and domain-driven architectures and eventually developed the OpenMFE specification and tooling. TUI later decided to adopt OpenMFE as a foundation of a modular web architecture. With its emphasis on portability and clearly defined interface contracts, the OpenMFE standard helped mastering the organisational and technological challenges of TUIâ€™s huge transformation. After his tenure at TUI, Alex continues to develop OpenMFE together with a team of enthusiasts and with endorsement from TUI.</p>
